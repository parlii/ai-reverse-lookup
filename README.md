# Word Finder

![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/parlii/ai-reverse-lookup/ci.yml?branch=main)

## üîç What Problem Does This Solve?

Have you ever experienced the frustrating "tip-of-the-tongue" phenomenon? You know exactly what a word means, but you just can't recall it. Word Finder solves this problem by allowing you to describe a word in natural language, and it will find the word you're looking for.

Unlike traditional dictionaries that require you to know the word to find its meaning, this reverse dictionary works the other way around - from meaning to word.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Powered Word Finding**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to find the perfect word based on your description
- **Multi-Language Support**: Find words in English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Hindi, and more
- **Audio Pronunciation**: Hear the correct pronunciation of found words with a single click
- **Word History**: Keep track of your previously found words for easy reference
- **Suggestion Feature**: Not sure what to look up? Get random word description suggestions
- **Beautiful UI**: Clean, responsive interface with dark mode for comfortable use
- **Markdown Formatting**: Results are beautifully formatted with word, pronunciation, definition, example usage, and etymology
